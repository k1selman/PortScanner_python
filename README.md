# Port Scanner written in Python

**Libraries used:** socket, subprocess, sys, datetime

**Idea:** Same as in C++ version - keep it simple. Input remote host to scan, however now we have every port in given range scanned, so if we are going from 1 to, for example, over 1000, the whole process may take some time.

**TODO:** Some basic modifications, try out some new ways of approaching things (if possbile) etc.
